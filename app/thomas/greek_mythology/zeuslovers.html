         Zeus Lovers

         As the sky god Zeus had easy access to the women of the world and took full advantage of it. Also, his power as a supreme god made him difficult to resist. Prior to his marriage to Hera he was married first to Metis, then Themis. He was interested in Demeter but she resisted him. His third wife was Mnemosyne. He was involved with Leto shortly before his marriage to Hera. The list of lovers after his final marriage, to Hera, is considerable:
<br>
             * Europa
             <br>
             * Io
             <br>
             * Semele
             <br>
             * Ganymede
             <br>
             * Callisto
             <br>
             * Leto 
             </h3>
