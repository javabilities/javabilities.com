    This is a site for many of our ideas and experiments. Many of these projects are incomplete and works in progress.
    The work that is completed is checked into a <a href="http://github.com/javabilities/" target="_blank">github account</a> and is availble to anyone.
    I have documented some of the more interesting parts of the projects on my <a href="http://blog.javabilities.com/" target="_blank">blog.</a>
